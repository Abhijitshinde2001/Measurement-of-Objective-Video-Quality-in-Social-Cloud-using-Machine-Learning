Project Title: Measurement of Objective Video Quality in Social Cloud using Machine 
Learning.

Description: 
The proposed system preprocesses data and extracts features from a video as 
data, as well as facilitating in the measurement of PSNR values, which can then 
be employed in subsequent prediction processes. 
As a result, the proposed system automates the process of feature extraction and 
predicts quality between original and uploaded videos, which not only saves 
time but also is effective when it comes to quality measurement prediction.
